= Conformance Test Suite - GML in JPEG 2000 2.0

== Scope

This executable test suite (ETS) verifies the conformance of JPEG 2000 codestreams against http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/08-085r4/08-085r4.html[OGC GML in JPEG 2000 (GMLJP2) Encoding Standard Part 1 (OGC 08-085r4)] and related specifications (see Figure 1). The JPEG 2000 standard (ISO 15444 series) is a wavelet-based encoding for imagery that provides the ability to include XML data for description of the image within the JPEG 2000 data file. Conformance testing is a kind of "black box" testing that examines externally visible characteristics or behaviors of the IUT and is independent of any implementation details.

.Relevant specifications
image::img/specifications.png[]

Several conformance classes are defined in the principal specifications; the ones listed below are covered by this test suite:

* Core (http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLJP2/2.0/req/core)
    - The Core specifies requirements have to implemented.

== Test requirements

The documents listed below stipulate requirements that must be satisfied by a conforming implementation.

== Test suite structure

The test suite definition file (testng.xml) is located in the root package, 
`org.opengis.cite.gmljpx20`. A conformance class corresponds to a &lt;test&gt; element, each
of which includes a set of test classes that contain the actual test methods. 
The general structure of the test suite is shown in Table 1.

The Javadoc documentation provides more detailed information about the test 
methods that constitute the suite.

== Using the REST API

Using the REST API of the TEAM Engine requires some run arguments. These ate summarized in Table 2.
The _Obligation_ descriptor can have the following values: M (mandatory), O (optional), or C (conditional).
